File format  - berth allocation with spatial constraints - Results Table 7 TS paper
------------------------------------------
first row: n number of vessels, m number of berths
m rows with n columns with processing times of the n vessels over the m berths
m rows with 3 values: s^k start of availability time of berth k, e^k end of availability time of berth k, s^k - e^k (redundant)
a row with n values: a_i arrival time of ship i; 
a row with n values:  b_i upper bound of the service time window on the ship i; (Note: in this instance set time windows upper bounds are disabled, then b_i has an high value > max e^k)
m rows with the following berth data: length left side, length right side, index of the left neighbor berth,index of the right neighbor berth 
(Note, if one of these last two values is zero, the berth presents an obstacle on that side).
a row with n values:  vessel length, including safety distance
The last row can be ignored
